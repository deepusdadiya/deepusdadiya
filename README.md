### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Deep Usdadiya.

As a dedicated learner with a background in Agriculture, I've transitioned seamlessly into the dynamic field of Data Science. Currently, I contribute my skills as a Data Scientist at Reliance Jio Infocom Ltd., specializing in back-end development, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning tasks for CloudXP, a Hybrid Cloud Management Platform. My responsibilities involve crafting APIs and leveraging advanced analytics to enhance the efficiency of AIOps within the organization.

Equipped with a robust foundation in Statistical modeling, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization, I thrive on unraveling insights and driving meaningful results. My journey from a B.Tech. in Agriculture Engineering to an MBA in Agriculture has uniquely positioned me to tackle challenges that demand technical expertise coupled with a profound understanding of the Agriculture industry. 

Let's connect and explore how my diverse skill set can contribute to innovative solutions in both the Data Science and Agriculture domains.
